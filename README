Cookie Clicker Endless Cycle Macro ‚Äî README

This app is a compiled AutoHotkey v2 script that automates a fast ascend
‚Üí reincarnate loop in the Steam version of Cookie Clicker.
It uses per‚Äëmonitor DPI awareness and absolute screen coordinates for
reliable clicking on mixed‚ÄëDPI multi‚Äëmonitor setups.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What it does (per cycle)

1.  Sets Buy Amount (you should have it on Max/100/10/1 as desired).
2.  For ~1.8 seconds it loops: Grandma ‚Üí Cursor ‚Üí Buy All Upgrades.
3.  Scrolls down the store and buys You (once, maxed).
4.  Scrolls back up to the top of the store.
5.  Spams Buy All Upgrades for ~0.8 seconds.
6.  Clicks Legacy ‚Üí Ascend ‚Üí waits 5.5s ‚Üí Reincarnate ‚Üí Yes.
7.  Waits a short buffer and repeats for the number of cycles you enter.

  The exact timings, scroll step counts, and delays are configurable
  (see Config).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

-   Windows 10/11.
-   Cookie Clicker (Steam) running windowed on the monitor you plan to
    use.
-   This compiled EXE (no AutoHotkey install required).
    If running the .ahk script instead of the EXE, install AutoHotkey
    v2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First run ‚Äî Calibration

The app guides you through a simple calibration. For each prompt:

1.  Hover the requested UI element in Cookie Clicker.
2.  Press Enter to capture the point.

Calibration sequence:

-   BuyAmtBtn ‚Äî Buy Amount (Max/100/10/1, at the top of the store).
-   Grandma ‚Äî the Grandma building tile (icon area).
-   Cursor ‚Äî the Cursor building tile (icon area).
-   BuyAllUpgrades ‚Äî the button under the upgrade icons.
-   ScrollAnchor ‚Äî any spot in the store/scrollbar area where the mouse
    wheel scrolls the store.
-   You ‚Äî scroll manually so You is visible once, then capture it.
-   Legacy ‚Äî top‚Äëright ‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù button.
-   Ascend ‚Äî the confirm button in the Ascend popup.
-   Reincarnate ‚Äî the Reincarnate button after ascending.
-   ReincarnateYes ‚Äî the final ‚ÄúYes‚Äù confirmation for reincarnating.

  Tip: After calibration, do not resize or move the Cookie Clicker
  window. If you do, re‚Äërun the EXE and recalibrate (it only takes a few
  seconds).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage

1.  Run the EXE.
2.  Complete the calibration prompts.
3.  When asked, enter the number of ascensions to run (start with 1 to
    verify).
4.  Watch it go. If anything is misaligned, just close the EXE and rerun
    to recalibrate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotkeys

This build does not add global hotkeys by design (no background
interception).
Control is via the pop‚Äëup prompts only.

  Want hotkeys (pause/resume, test calibration, dry‚Äërun)? They can be
  added easily later, but this EXE sticks to the stable, prompt‚Äëonly
  flow you locked in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Config (edit only if you recompile)

You can tweak these values near the top of the script before compiling:

    global clickDelay := 100                 ; ms between clicks
    global grandmaCursorUpgradeDuration := 1800 ; ms, duration of the Grandma‚ÜíCursor‚ÜíUpgrades loop
    global upgradesDuration := 800           ; ms, spam Buy All Upgrades after buying You
    global waitBeforeReincarnate := 5500     ; ms, delay after Ascend before clicking Reincarnate
    global loopGapMs := 2000                 ; ms, buffer between cycles
    global scrollStepsForYou := 6            ; how many WheelDown steps to reveal You
    global scrollDelayMs := 50               ; ms between scroll wheel events

Adjusting scroll:
If ‚ÄúYou‚Äù isn‚Äôt visible, increase scrollStepsForYou (e.g., 8‚Äì12). If it
scrolls too far, decrease it. The script performs a double pass (two
scroll loops) down and back up for safety.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tips & Troubleshooting

-   Click misses slightly: Re‚Äërun and recalibrate. Don‚Äôt resize/move the
    game window afterward.
-   Multi‚Äëmonitor drift: Run CC on the primary monitor or keep it on one
    monitor consistently during runs.
-   Protected clicks: If the EXE can‚Äôt move/click, try Run as
    Administrator.
-   Game updates/UI scale changes: recalibrate once and you‚Äôre good.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety

This macro automates clicking inside Cookie Clicker only. Use at your
own risk.
Don‚Äôt use while typing in other apps‚Äîkeep the CC window focused during
runs.
